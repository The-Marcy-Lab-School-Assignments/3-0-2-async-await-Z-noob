# Question
Using `async`/`await` over `.then`/`.catch` makes our code for handling promises much more readable. What are the ways in which `async`/`await` is more readable than `.then` and `.catch`?

# Answer

 `async`/`await is more readable then `.then`/`.catch` because in a way it can write asynchronous code in a synchronous style, making it easier to understand the flow of execution. It also writes asynchronous codes in a more linear and readable way. On top of the the `try` and `catch` is more concise making it easier to understand and maintain.
